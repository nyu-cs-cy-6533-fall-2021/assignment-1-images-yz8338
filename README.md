# Implementation & Result

## Task 1: Image Class

For this task, I implemented a general image class *MyImageClass*. This class contains constructors: MyImageClass() and MyImageClass(const char* filename), which are used for creating default empty image and loading image. It also has the *save* method, which can save images in "P2", "P3" or "P5", "P6" formats. All other tasks are also done by adding methods to *MyImageClass*.

By using given pictures *Mandrill.ppm* and *Mandrill-gray.ppm*, let us test reading and saving pictures by:
```bash
MyImageClass image1("../../images/Mandrill.ppm");
image1.save("../../images/p3/changed_pic.ppm");

MyImageClass image1("../../images/Mandrill-gray.ppm");
image1.save("../../images/p6/changed_pic.ppm");
```
The results are saved in *p3* and *p6* directories respectively as follows:

![changed_pic](Assignment_1/figures/p3/changed_pic.png)


## Task 2: Operations on Images

## Task 3: Gamma Correction

## Task 4: Alpha Compositing
